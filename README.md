# HaskLAB

HaskLAB is part of my final project for subject "Programming Languages Anaylsis". It consists of a numeric computing environment, that enables the user to manipullate real valued functions in a wide variety of ways, ranging from numerical integration and derivation to interpolation and plotting. The implementation is 100% Haskell, which caters for users needing high performance.

* Plotting
* Calculation of derivatives
* Function composition
* Calculation of roots
* Integration
* Interpolation (using Taylor polynomials)

Features:
- Easy-to-use interactive console interface. Parsing was done using Yaxx.
- Extensive documentation using help commands within the program. Detailed error messages.
- Functions can be defined interactively (in the console), or loaded from files.
- A comprehensive manual (in Spanish) is provided, along with a tutorial and examples.
